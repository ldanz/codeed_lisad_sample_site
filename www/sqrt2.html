    <h2>Claim</h2>
    The square root of 2 is irrational.
    <h2>Proof</h2>
    <p>This is a proof by contradiction.</p>
    <h3>Assumption</h3>
    <p>Assume that <i>sqrt(2)</i> is rational, so it is equal to the ratio of two positive integers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>.  That is, we suppose that <i>sqrt(2) = a / b</i>, where <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are integers and the fraction is in lowest terms.</p>
    <h3>Logical deductions</h3>
    <p>By the problem setup, we have <i>2 = a^2 / b^2</i>.</p>
    <p>This implies <i>2b^2 = a^2</i>.</p>
    <p>Since <i>a^2</i> is equal to 2 times an integer, it must be even.  Since the square of an even number is even and the square of an odd number is odd, we know that <i>a</i> must be even.</p>
    <p>Since <i>a</i> is even, that means that <i>a = 2c</i> for some integer <i>c</i>, so <i>a^2 = (2c)^2 = 4c^2</i>.</p>
    <p>This implies that <i>2b^2 = 4c^2</i>.  We can devide by 2 on both sides and get <i>b^2 = 2c^2</i>.</p>
    <p>By the same logic used above, this implies that <i>b</i> is even.</p>
    <p>Since <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are both even, we can reduce the fraction <i>a/b</i> by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2.</p>
    <p>However, this <span style="color:#cc0000"><u>contradicts</u></span> our assumption that the fraction was in lowest terms, which proves the original statement.</p>
