    <h2>Claim</h2>
    <p>There are infinitely many prime numbers.</p>
    <h2>Proof</h2>
    <p>This is a proof by contradiction.</p>
    <h3>Assumption</h3>
    <p>Suppose that there are finitely many prime numbers, <i>p1</i>, <i>p2</i>, <i>p3</i>, ... , <i>pn</i>, where <i>n</i> is a positive integer.</p>
    <h3>Logical deductions</h3>
    <p>Consider the product of the prime numbers.  Call it <i>P</i>.  So we have <i>P = p1 * p2 * ... * pn</i>.</p>
    <p>Now consider <b>one more</b> than this number, <i>P + 1</i>.</p>
    <p>By the distributive property, if one of the primes, say <i>px</i>, divides <i>P + 1</i>, then since <i>px</i> also divides <i>P</i>, <i>px</i> must divide 1.  But the only integer that divides 1 is 1, and 1 is not prime, so there is no such <i>px</i>.  Therefore, <i>P + 1</i> is not devisible by any lower prime numbers, which implies that <i>P + 1</i> is prime, which <span style="color:#cc0000"><u>contradicts</u></span> the assumption that <i>p1</i>, <i>p2</i>, ... , <i>pn</i> was the full list.</p>
